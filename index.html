              <h3>- Childhood -</h3>
                <p>As a child, eventhough I lived in Subang Jaya, my parents sent my siblings to study at Kuala Lumpur as it is near to my mother's workplace. Everyday after school, I'd go to my mother's workplace and either do homeworks or make a ball out of paper and play football infront of the lifts with my little brother. On some days, I'd go to the office's library and uses their computers there and play games with friends. Next, for every fridays, me and my friends would go to friday pray by walking to Masjid Negara. We've tried a lot of different ways to go there such as main roads, dark underground tunnels and even went through Bukit Aman Police Station. Once, we met a drug-addict at the tunnel and everyone would run back really fast and scream. </p>

              <h3>- Teenager -</h3>
                <p>As a teenager, I got into a highschool in Subang Jaya. As someone who used to study at Kuala Lumpur, it is totally a new environment and faces around me. As a part of an introvert myself, I do not know how to communicate or interact with new people so I would alwyas just go alone anywhere.Then, on the 2nd year, I found my best friend and we would do anything together. From there, starts the development of our friendship and I started to know a lot more people. In these ages, it is normal to feel a lot of burden from studies as our future depends on it. It was pretty depressing everytime I get my exam results especially PT3 but I can't put a blame on anyone but myself as I don't even bother to make an effort. For my 4th and 5th year, I got into a class where I'll be learning about accounting and science computer as an elective subjet. I got through these years thanks to the teachers who taught me without giving up.</p>

              <h3>- Adult -</h3>
                <p>After graduated from high school, a disaster happened not long after as I got into a car accident. Luckily, it was not so traumatising and it has been dealt with as soon as possible. Next, while waiting for SPM results, I applied for a part-time job at Shell Gas Station. I worked there for about a month til Covid-19 was introduced to the world. It is pretty unfortunate to work only for a month because it lessen my experiences. I also got into trouble during my time as a part-time worker where I made a mistake and made a customer's car from getting started. I panicked as I do not know what to do but luckily, the customer calmed me down and does not make a ruckus about it. He told me not to worry about it as people make mistakes but I still felt bad.  Ups and downs happens in life. Therefore, I should take these as a reason to become stronger in the future and took it as a life lessons. </p>
